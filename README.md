Clone and setup the [yara-backend repo](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/yara-backend) for uploading the scan results.

Download and install the [yara binary](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettingstarted.html).

For the moment, compile the IBM rules with `yarac` and put them in `/tmp/malware_detection_rules.yar`.

Edit `config/filesystem_include.txt` as necessary to specify which filesystem objects (files/directories) to scan.

Then run the client, preferably as root for a complete scan:

    # python client.py

The client configuration is in `config/client.conf`.

It also takes a number of optional command line arguments.  Use the `-h` option for help:

    # python client.py [-h] [-d] [-r RULES_LOCATION] [-s FILE|DIR|PID]

Note, at this time the client has only been tested to work on RHEL or similar Linux hosts.
