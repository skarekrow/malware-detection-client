#   minus kernel virtual filesystems (/cgroups, /proc, /sys) and any items specified in the filesystem_exclude.txt file.
#
# Specify one item per line and ensure items paths start from root (/).
# Partial directory paths, linked files/directories and lines starting with # are ignored.  Wildcards are not supported.
